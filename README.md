The repository is for The Odin Project's project to make a simple game of rock, paper and scissor.

In making this project I have spent a lot of time in planning and breaking down the project into subproblems which help to find the solution faster.

The script.js file also contains the pseudocode commented out so that it is easier to understand for beginners what is done in the code.
